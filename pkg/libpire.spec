* Fri Nov 08 2013 Dmitry Prokoptsev <dprokoptsev@yandex-team.ru> 0.0.5-my1
- Fixed lots of compatibility issues (clang, libc++,
  older & newer autotools, older & newer bison, etc...)
- Added a valgrind-friendly memory fetch.
- Added an "r" option for pire_inline as a shortcut for Fsm::Reverse.
- Dumping of FSM has been rewritten in DOT language.
- Fixed handling of escape sequences in pire_inline.
- Made pire_inline put '#line' directive on a top of its output file.
- Added a simple "Do what I mean" mode.
- Explicitly restricted build on systems where uint64_t requires custom alignment.
- Improvements in shortcutting logic.
- Binary format of scanners compatible across diffesent platform having
  the same word size and endianness.
- Made pire_inline capable of handling comments inside regexp definitions.
- Made pire_inline capable of agglutinating multiple regexps, producing a single scanner.

* Wed Nov 17 2010 Dmitry Prokoptsev <dprokoptsev@yandex-team.ru> 0.0.4-my1
- Implemented SSE2-bases shortcutting, resulting
  in dramatic performance boost on simple regexps;
